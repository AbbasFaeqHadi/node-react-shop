              Our Story
            </h2>
            <p className="leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Online Fashion was founded with the belief that shopping for
              clothing should be simple, fast, and enjoyable. We are an
              international clothing brand that focuses on combining quality
              with simplicity, giving you access to the latest fashion trends
              without complications. From the beginning, our goal has been to
              streamline the entire shopping experienceâ€”whether that means
              providing clear and easy navigation, offering flexible return
              policies, or ensuring you receive your purchase without
              unnecessary delays.
